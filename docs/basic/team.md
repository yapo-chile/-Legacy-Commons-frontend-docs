I started working at Yapo in March 2020. I like to define myself as a person passionate about learning and creating. The things i love the most are spending time with my family, composing music, drawing and... playing and developing small solo video-games. The things i hate the most are using public transport (metro in particular), talking in front of people, and bad customer service (wich seems to be the norm in Chile). Small facts about me: my favorite food is spaghetti, my zodiac sign is Aries, i prefer cats over dogs (but i like both), i studied one year of architecture before studying IT and i hate the feeling of emptyness that leaves you a sad movie. You can approach me if you have any questions about Frontend, or just want to talk about music, video games, or anything.
