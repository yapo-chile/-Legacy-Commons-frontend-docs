Since January 2017 I have been working in this great family of great people called Yapo. I work in web development since 2013, I worked in advertising agencies, I work freelance and now in Yapo too. I enjoy learning new things, languages​​, and frameworks.

I love solving problems, everything types of bug, my mind always is working to do there best job any process that I am involved. I listen music and then I exist, love funky music, my favorite band is Jamiroquai. The better talks are with humility people, life is short so you must learn to fly quickly. I follow the road of the autodidact and I am a proactive person, think it's revolutionary.  I find huge motivation in sport, love trekking and the bike is my best transport. 

My son is my heart and covers my soul with love <3

My favorites series are Breaking Bad, Mr. Robot, Peaky Blinders, Mindhunter, True Detective, Hunter X Hunter, Naruto Shippuden, Bleach. My favorites movies are La vita è bella, BreaveHeart, Dance with Wolves, and all Movies from Studio Ghibli, the best movie Howl's Moving Castle (Howl no Ugoku Shiro). Like a lot the writer Haruki Murakami and one of his best books is ‘Una crónica del pájaro que da cuerda al mundo’.

## Fabián Urbina

I started working at Yapo in March 2020. I like to define myself as a person passionate about learning and creating. The things i love the most are spending time with my family, composing music, drawing and... playing and developing small solo video-games. The things i hate the most are using public transport (metro in particular), talking in front of people, and bad customer service (wich seems to be the norm in Chile). Small facts about me: my favorite food is spaghetti, my zodiac sign is Aries, i prefer cats over dogs (but i like both), i studied one year of architecture before studying IT and i hate the feeling of emptyness that leaves you a sad movie. You can approach me if you have any questions about Frontend, or just want to talk about music, video games, or anything.
